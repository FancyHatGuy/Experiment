A list of ideas that I have to experiment and play around with. 
*Java - The Purge counter. A counter for the Carbyne gametype "The Purge". For getting familiar with Java
*Java - Binary Knight. A simple sidescrolling platformer game. 
*KSP - Mission Control. Programmable instructions into probes and rovers.  
*KSP - Gundam. Humanoid robots. 
*Java - Carbyne Updater Bot (CUB) Checks a server for update information (release date, upload) and pushes them.
